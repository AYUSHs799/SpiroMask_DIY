# ML Models

This folder contains machine learning models implemented using Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms. The models have been trained and evaluated using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) technique.

## Models Included

The folder consists of the following models:

* **Random Forest Model**: The Random Forest model is a powerful ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It is known for its effectiveness in handling complex datasets and providing robust results.

* **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Model** : The MLP model is a type of artificial neural network with multiple layers of interconnected nodes. It is capable of learning complex patterns and non-linear relationships in the data.

## LOOCV (Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation)

Both models have been trained and evaluated using the LOOCV technique. LOOCV is a resampling method where each data point is iteratively used as the validation set, while the remaining data is used for training. This process is repeated for every data point, resulting in a robust evaluation of the model's performance.

LOOCV offers several advantages, including reducing bias and providing a reliable estimate of the model's generalization performance. By using LOOCV, we can effectively assess the models' accuracy and make informed decisions about their suitability for real-world applications.
